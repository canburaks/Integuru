_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the README.md to reflect the current Poetry behavior.

```markdown:README.md
// ... existing code ...

## Development Setup

To activate the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry env use python3
poetry install
poetry env activate
```

// ... existing code ...
```

This updates the instructions to use Poetry's recommended `env activate` command instead of the deprecated `shell` command.
